# Nuclear Testing

**Description**

The visualization consists of vertical lines, each line represents a year from 1945-2017, another line cuts through the vertical lines from the center horizontally, which is the baseline that holds the total number of Nuclear tests in red circles in that year.
Every year some countries had done the Nuclear Testing above or underground, and this could be determined by looking at the position of the vertical line, if the baseline is at 50% of the vertical line, it means that in that year atmospeheric and underground testing are equal in percentages.
The red circles size show the overall total Nuclear tests in every year.
